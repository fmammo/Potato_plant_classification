POTATO PLANT CLASSIFICATION

INTRODUCTION/PROBLEM STATEMENT

The purpose of these project is to prevent farmers who grow potatoes from economic loss because of major two disease that can happen to potato plants. If a farmer detects these dieses early and apply an appropriate treatment they can be saved from the economic loss. The treatment for both diseases are different so it is very important to differentiate them. Data gathered from Kaggle data science competition platform.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The data has 3 classes, 2 diseases called (early_blight and late_blight) and the other one is healthy. And, It is a colored image.Main insight from the exploration is that: only by looking at the leaf it is hard to make a decision if the plant is healthy or not. For instance, the leaf might be very green but not healthy and vice versa. What I wanted to say is, ML has a high impact to get a better result in case of analysis and findings but not always. So, it is important that implementing  ML classification model for this specific project problem statement. 

 ML MODEL

 CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)

 Pre-processing stage I have used different techniques for instance; rescaling, resizing and data augmentation. And the best model is a model which has a 96% accuracy result.

 
 FOR FUTURE WORK

 I would recommend adding additional data, it might be related to another type of potato plant dieses; so that to be able to do a more robust model. Second would be just optimize the model through different techniques then thirdly create a fully functional mobile app so that the farmers can use it easily.
